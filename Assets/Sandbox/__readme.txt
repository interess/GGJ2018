Sanbox should be used for all quick experiments.

Code in sandbox should live in global namespace.

Code in sandbox should live in folders, not in root of Sandbox.

Sandbox MonoBehaviours allowed to be attached only to GameObjects in scenes, that have "_Sandbox" in their names, e.g. "Container_Battlefield_Sandbox".

Please leave __readme.txt files for Sandbox experiments.
Please delete sandbox code if it's obsolete.
